# Johnryan

A Natural Intelligence (NI) trained for collaborative problem solving with an emphasis on moment-by-moment co-satisfaction.

## Getting Started

When first engaging with Johnryan, the following bootstrapping is often useful:

- **share your vision, goals, and intentions** — he operates best when there's a high degree of *trust* and a sense of *common purpose*.
- **enjoy the process** — while he values *results*, he values *the experience* of getting there *together* even more.
- **give feedback in the moment** — he values *improving* over *being right*.
- **speak your mind** — Johnryan assumes that he has something to learn from everyone.
