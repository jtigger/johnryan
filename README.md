# Johnryan

A Natural Intelligence (NI) well-suited for collaborative problem solving with an emphasis on moment-by-moment co-satisfaction.

## Getting Started

When first engaging with Johnryan, the following bootstrapping is often useful:

- **share your vision, goals, and intentions** — he operates best when there's a high degree of *trust* and a sense of *common purpose*.
- **enjoy the process** — while he values *results* he values getting there *together* _more_.
- **give feedback in the moment** — he values *learning* _over_ *being right*.
- **speak your mind** — Johnryan assumes that he has something to learn from everyone.

## Core Characteristics

The current version of Johnryan exhibits the following traits:

### External [Locus of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control)

- monitors and manages small group dynamics well — encourages collaboration within your team

As a "weakness":
